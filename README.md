# pop-up-box

In this project, I demonstrate how to create a visually appealing pop-up modal box using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The pop-up is designed to display a thank-you or success message, complete with a smooth transition effect as it appears on the screen. Viewers will see how to integrate a button that triggers the pop-up and an 'OK' button to close it.
